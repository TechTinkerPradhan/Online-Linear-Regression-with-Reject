# Online-Linear-Regression-with-Reject

This project implements an online linear regression model, focusing on real-time data updates and adaptability to changing conditions. The goal is to showcase the advantages of online linear regression, particularly in industries with resource constraints, where traditional machine learning approaches might be impractical. I have used a Vehicles data set, of cars and thier attributes to determine the target of milage "comb08".
